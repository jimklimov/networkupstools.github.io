# I have a Castle C1K on hand, which is an online ("double conversion")
# UPS with two built-in 12V batteries and 1kVA output capacity.
# I can make it work by using blazer_ser driver.

# Most things work. The battery voltage reports 2.28 because the
# Castle C*K series it reports the battery voltage as the multiplier
# of voltage of single piece of battery (2.28 * 12V = 27.36V),
# unlike the MT*-PRO series that reports the voltage directly.
# This can be solved by setting flags in ups.conf:
#
#   override.battery.voltage.nominal = 24
#   override.battery.packs = 12
#
# ...in theory, but seems like it does not work
