# DEVICE:URL:VENDOR: https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/battery-backup/bl1250u/

# DEVICE:COMMENT:
# In earlier setup, manually set `port=/dev/hidraw0` (`auto` did not work).
#
# In later comments of the ticket, both worked and `hidraw` experiments
# returned much more data than `auto`.
#
# Finally, after a reboot `hidraw` no longer worked but `auto` behaved well.
