# CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U - Inexpensive 1U rack mount UPS
# https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/or500lcdrm1u/

# This UPS has the same ondelay/offdelay issue that other Cyberpower UPS's
# have, the UPS expects minutes for those values, and rounds down.
# So the default values of 20 and 30 get rounded down so the UPS shuts
# off immediately.

# The ondelay for this model doesn't work very well.
# If you give it a value of 60 seconds, the UPS will power back
# on the load after 60 seconds even if the mains power isn't back.
# An ondelay=-1 disables the auto start behavior.
# Setting an ondelay value of 0 seems to be the only useful value.
# With ondelay=0 the UPS will start back up immediately if the power
# is restored after the UPS shuts down, and it will restart the load
# approximately 10 seconds after a shutdown if the power comes back
# after the shutdown with delay command is sent.
# I would suggest that if the default values are changed for cyberpower
# models, that the ondelay be set to a default of 0, and the
# offdelay be set to 60.

# I've successfully tested the shutdown behavior with this UPS with
# a FreeBSD system (pfSense firewall). The offdelay must be set greater
# than 60 and the ondelay must be set to 0 for correct behavior.
# (FreeBSD doesn't remount into a RO mode during shutdown, so delayed
# shutdown is absolutely needed to prevent disk corruption).

# One last note is that this system doesn't seem to have any nonvolatile
# storage, any values set via upsrw are lost when the UPS is restarted.
# So if you want to tweak certain settings you will need to have a way
# to reset them any time the UPS resets.
