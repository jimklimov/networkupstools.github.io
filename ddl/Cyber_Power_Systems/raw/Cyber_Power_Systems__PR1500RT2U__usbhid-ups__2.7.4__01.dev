# Tested shutdown and the master and all slaves shutdown at LB as expected (35%)

# Some commands don't appear to work went sent through upscmd and upsrw.
# battery.charge.low value doesn't seem to be user changeable (known issue).

# Some of the reported values appear off as well: output.voltage I would
# expect to be ~120v and the battery voltages also appear incorrect.
# The UPS LCD reports 4 12v cells in series for 48v nominal ~54v actual.
