# From https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/1080 :

# The UPS looks to be using working with the blazer_usb driver,
# different status events are properly reported and my connected
# Raspberry Pi shuts down as expected, but the UPS itself does
# not shut down.

# Later discussion in the ticket mentioned that nutdrv_qx worked
# but did not detail to what extent, except a subsequent comment
#   If I would be able to disable the beeper then I would
#   have achieved all my goals: beeper.toggle command works,
#   but the driver settings alarm_control = disabled and
#   battery_alarm = disabled don't do anything..

# The (v2.7.4) nut-scanner tool suggested nutdrv_atcl_usb driver
# according to vendorid/productid which is used in many unrelated
# devices, that driver did not support the (Qx) protocol here.

# maxretry = 3
# pollinterval = 5
# [greencell]
#   driver = "blazer_usb"
#   port = "auto"
#   langid_fix = 0x409
