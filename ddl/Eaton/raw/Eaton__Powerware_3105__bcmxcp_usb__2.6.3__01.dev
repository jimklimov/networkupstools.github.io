#CMD:shutdown.return
#CMD:shutdown.stayoff
# shutdown.stayoff:COMMENT:
# 'shutdown.stayoff' powers off immediately (no shutdown delay), and then powers on again when line power is available.
# shutdown.stayoff:EOC
#CMD:test.battery.start	#BAD
# test.battery.start:COMMENT:
# 'test.battery.start' does not have any noticeable effect: the device does not report any battery information so it's impossible to know if it actually does a test and what the results are (but most likely it just does nothing).
