# battery.runtime:COMMENT:
# .Notes on calibration
# 1. It's important that the UPS is at 100% charge before starting the procedure; starting at lower will not work at all, not just produce inaccurate numbers.
# +
# I started the procedure when the UPS was at 91% charge.
# After that it would never report being more than 20% charge, even after leaving it plugged in for hours; running the procedure in FAQ #37 never left it reporting more than 20 seconds of charge left, which I verified was incorrect.
#
# 2. If for some reason the UPS never reaches 100% charge, this can be remedied (in the ACP ES-750 case), by leaving it unplugged for 1 week.
# +
# Doing this allowed me to recover from the case in '1' above.
# After that the procedure below, as in http://excessups.com/blog/manual-runtime-calibration-apc-ups/, worked fine.
#
# .Manual Runtime Calibration for APC UPS
# 1. Battery must be at 100% capacity when the Runtime Calibration is initiated/started. (charge the UPS for 24hours prior)
# 2. The UPS must have 30-34% load on it during the calibration (Constant load, try: lamps, computers, monitors. Measure load % by PowerChute)
# 3. Disconnect the serial/USB comm cable from the UPS (you don’t want PowerChute to shut down equipment)
# 4. The battery must be discharged completely  (unplug UPS from wall outlet, let the UPS to shut off completely due to a discharged battery).
# 5. Remove the attached load (ie – lights, computers)
# 6. Let the UPS charge for 8 hours while OFF (plug back into utility power, press OFF button when UPS turns ON)
# 7. Turn on UPS (run time should now be accurate)
