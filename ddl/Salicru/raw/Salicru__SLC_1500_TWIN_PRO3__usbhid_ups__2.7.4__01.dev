# $ upsrw -s battery.runtime.low Unity
# Enter new value for battery.runtime.low: 240
# OK

# $ upsc Unity battery.runtime.low
# 240
# I successfully set the “ups.delay.shutdown” from 20 to 120 via “upsrw -s ups.delay.shutdown Unity” command

# $ upscmd -l Unity
# Instant commands supported on UPS [Unity]:
#
# load.off - Turn off the load immediately
# load.off.delay - Turn off the load with a delay (seconds)
# load.on - Turn on the load immediately
# load.on.delay - Turn on the load with a delay (seconds)
# shutdown.return - Turn off the load and return when power is back
# shutdown.stayoff - Turn off the load and remain off
# shutdown.stop - Stop a shutdown in progress
# test.battery.start.deep - Start a deep battery test
# test.battery.start.quick - Start a quick battery test
# test.battery.stop - Stop the battery test
#
# Send command “upscmd Unity load.off” , the output voltage has changed from 230.2 to 0 after loading off.
# Send command “upscmd Unity load.on”, the output voltage has changed from 0 to 230.2 after loading on.
