# As others have noted in PowerWalker-related issues, the Liebert HID subdriver
# seems to be lacking certain features. For instance input/output voltage,
# frequency and configurable options are missing.

# The VID 0x06da PID 0xffff is also defined in mge-hid subdriver, which seems
# to have more features than the liebert subdriver, however I have had no luck
# with tricking the driver into using it by just changing the config.
