# Manufacturer: PowerWalker
# Model: VI 3000 SCL

# UPS sends a low battery signal that makes NUT issue a shutdown.
# battery.charge.low and battery.runtime.low were only set as
# failsafes during testing.

# Protocol is mustek. NOTE THAT nutdrv_qx doesnt connect even
# though it also detects it as mustek like blazer_usb, go figure.

# UPS load value is always working correctly.
# Temperature is only output when UPS is on battery, value seems correct.
# Vendor detection has to be disabled! It doesnt give out information
#  (fails) and causes the UPS to not answer all the time!
# Runtime and chargetime based on Manufacturer datasheet,
#  Min/Max Voltages measured. (Brand new unit)

# UPS commands:
#  beeper.toggle works, also gives out the correct value.
#  load.on works
#  load.off works
#  shutdown.return works
#  shutdown.stayoff doesnt work
#  shutdown.stop works
#  test.battery.start.deep doesnt work, responds with OK, but no action
#  test.battery.start.quick sometimes works, always responds OK, test is sub 5 seconds
#  test.battery.start value doesnt work, responds with OK, but no action
#  test.battery.stop useless, because only the 5 second test works
