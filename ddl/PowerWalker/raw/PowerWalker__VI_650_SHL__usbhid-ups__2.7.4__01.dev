# I bought a recent BlueWalker / PowerWalker UPS from Amazon.
# The exact Product description string from the package is:
# "PowerWalker VI 650/850 SHL". I bought the 650VA version
# The serial number shows week 43/2018 as manufacturing date.
# Syslog says: 06da:ffff Phoenixtec Power Co., Ltd

# Serial Number is shown as zeroes and not edited out,
# as already discussed in #475.

# It identified as a HID device in syslog so I tried usbhid-ups
# on it - with success:

# :; upsc powerwalker
