Build fixes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: circle; "><li class="listitem">
In general, numerous fixes were applied to ensure portability and avoid
     warnings (fixing a number of real bugs that caused them); CI was extended
     to keep the codebase free of those types of warnings which we have got
     rid of, requiring builds to succeed cleanly in several dozen combinations
     of compiler versions, C standard revisions (C99 upwards, though on many
     OSes with GNU99+ extensions), operating systems and CPU architectures.
</li><li class="listitem">
Public CI introduced to automatically test every contribution (PR) and
     resulting increment of main NUT codebase, including Travis CI and LGTM.com
     services, and a Jenkins farm on virtual hardware donated by Fosshost.org;
     this augments testing earlier provided for some branches by Buildbot.
</li><li class="listitem">
Added cppunit testing with valgrind for the C++ client library
</li><li class="listitem">
Make targets added for shell script syntax checks for helper and service
     scripts
</li><li class="listitem">
Make targets added for spellcheck and for maintenance of the dictionary,
     including incremental spellcheck to only parse recently edited text files
</li><li class="listitem">
The AsciiDoc detection has been reworked to allow NUT to be built from
     source without requiring asciidoc/a2x (using pre-built man pages from
     the distribution tarball, for instance)
</li><li class="listitem">
Makefile contents rearranged for more resilient out-of-tree and in-tree
     builds beside those made from the root workspace directory
</li><li class="listitem">
Makefiles are tested with GNU Make and BSD Make to ensure portable recipes
</li><li class="listitem">
More use of <code class="literal">pkg-config</code> to detect dependencies at configure time, as
     well as fail-safe detection of presence of pkg-config (and its macros)
     to survive and build without it too
</li><li class="listitem">
"slibtool" pedantic nuances now supported, allowing an alternative to
     GNU libtool
</li><li class="listitem">
Build scripts updated to remove obsoleted calls to cleanly work with

     earlier release since 2012)
</li><li class="listitem">
Dynamic library loading used in certain programs and use-cases improved,

Numerous classes of compilation warnings eradicated, many of those being

     structure fields; some more in progress
</li><li class="listitem">
Several logical errors found and fixed during this walk over codebase.
</li><li class="listitem">
Cases where compilers were overly zealous and particular code was written
     the way wit was intentionally, including some comparisons that help with
     different-bitness builds but indeed seem superfluous in a certain single
     bitness, were commented and encased in pragmas to disable the warnings
</li><li class="listitem">
Basic coding style (indentations, lack of trailing white space) applied
     per developer guide, but not automatically enforced/checked yet.
</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">
Due to changes needed to resolve build warnings, mostly about mismatching
   data types for some variables, some structure definitions and API signatures
   of several routines had to be changed for argument types, return types,
   or both. Primarily this change concerns internal implementation details
   (may impact update of NUT forks with custom drivers using those), but a
   few changes also happened in header files installed for builds configured
   <code class="literal">--with-dev</code> and so may impact <code class="literal">upsclient</code> and <code class="literal">nutclient</code> (C++) consumers.
   At the very least, binaries for those consumers should be rebuilt to remain
   stable with NUT 2.8.0 and not mismatch int-type sizes and other arguments.

   The last release (2.6.5) is almost a year old. A lot of work has
   been done, but a good amount remains to achieve 2.8.0 goals.
   Please read the <a class="ulink" href="UPGRADING.adoc" target="_top">UPGRADING.adoc</a> notes.

Website hosting: free NUT from Eaton website hosting
  
  
   NUT website (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.networkupstools.org" target="_top">https://www.networkupstools.org</a>) is no longer hosted by Eaton.
   Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on his own,
   to give NUT back some independence.
  
  
   This effort is also part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for
   contributions from others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual).
   The new hosting service is located, as for Arnaud’s blog
   (<a class="ulink" href="http://arnaud.quette.fr" target="_top">http://arnaud.quette.fr</a>) on Gandi servers, using PaaS.

This release fixes an important vulnerability in upsd
   (CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed)
  
  
   NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3, are exposed to
   crashes when receiving random data from the network.
  
  
   This issue is related to the way NUT parses characters,
   especially from the network. Non printable characters were missed
   from strings operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the
   buffer, causing an overflow.
  
  
   Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset of ASCII charset from
   <code class="literal">Space</code> to <code class="literal">~</code>
   (Reported by Sebastian Pohle, Alioth bug <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues/313636" target="_top">#313636</a>, CVE-2012-2944)

The new naming scheme for variables and commands (introduced in 1.4)
   is now mandatory.  The 1.4 tree supported both the old (STATUS) and
   the new (ups.status) as a transitional release, and now that time is
   over.
  
  
   This means that 2.0 is generally smaller than 1.4 code, since the
   interim compatibility hacks have been removed.
</li><li class="listitem">
New serial handling code has been added, with greatly simplified
   operations.  The old mess involving repeated calls to sigaction,
   alarm, and read has been condensed to a select-read loop.
  
  
   This change allows drivers which don’t do any serial communications
   at all (hidups, snmp-ups) to drop that baggage, so they are a bit
   smaller when compiled.
</li><li class="listitem">
The drivers now recognize "chroot=' and <span class="emphasis"><em>user=</em></span> in the global section
   of ups.conf.  This means you don’t have to use -r and -u when
   starting upsdrvctl.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsmon now supports the -K argument to check for the presence of the
   POWERDOWNFLAG file.  If it exists and contains the magic string, then
   upsmon will exit(EXIT_SUCCESS).  Otherwise, it will
   exit(EXIT_FAILURE).
  
  
   This feature can be used to simplify shutdown scripts, since now you
   don’t have to keep the script in sync with the upsmon.conf.
</li><li class="listitem">
Many small things like signed value comparisons, int vs. size_t and
   proper use of const/struct were fixed throughout the source.  These
   were mostly for correctness, but a few potential bugs involving very
   big or very small numbers were fixed at the same time.
</li><li class="listitem">
The access control system in upsd.conf has been reworked and
   simplified.  Since access levels have become meaningless in recent
   releases, the new system is just ACCEPT &lt;acl&gt; or REJECT &lt;acl&gt;.
  
  
   If you are upgrading from a previous version of the software, you
   will have to edit your upsd.conf to use this method.  See
   the <a class="ulink" href="UPGRADING.adoc" target="_top">UPGRADING.adoc</a> file for more details.

The newapc driver has been renamed to apcsmart, replacing the old
   driver with that name. If you used the newapc driver, be sure to
   delete the old binary and fix your ups.conf.
</li><li class="listitem">
The apcsmart driver now supports asynchronous notification data
   from the hardware, which means it can wake up as soon as something
   happens.  This affects the OL/OB/LB/RB data in ups.status, and
   generally reduces the latency in dispatching status changes by a few
   seconds.
</li><li class="listitem">
The apcsmart driver can now support quirky hardware which does not
   provide the usual listing of valid command characters.  This feature
   is necessary to monitor new models like the APC CS 350 and old ones
   like the Matrix 5000.  It also now has sdtype=4 to handle the strange
   shutdown behavior on the CS series.
</li><li class="listitem">
The belkin driver now works around broken firmware version 001,

The drivers and upsd now communicate over Unix domain sockets instead
   of state files, shared memory, or state files with mmap.  This change
   makes many things possible, including the new dynamic variable and
   command naming scheme described below.
  
  
   There is a new development tool called sockdebug in the server
   directory for debugging driver-server communications on the sockets.
</li><li class="listitem">
The old static variable scheme has been replaced by a new dynamic
   implementation.  Vague names have been turned into meaningful names
   that fit into an organized system.  UTILITY is now input.voltage.
   OUTVOLT is now output.voltage.
  
  
   This also applies to the names of instant commands.  BTEST1 is
   test.battery.start, and BTEST0 is test.battery.stop.
  
  
   The old names are still supported for compatibility with older
   clients.  This compatibility mode will be maintained throughout
   the 1.4 series, and will be gone by the release of 2.0.  Users
   with older clients are encouraged to upgrade their software
   during this time.
</li><li class="listitem">
The network protocol has been expanded to handle these new names.
   Older functions which only apply to the old names will continue to
   be supported through the 1.4 series.
</li><li class="listitem">
The drivers and server (upsd) can now change their user ids and
   chroot themselves with the new -u and -r arguments.  This lets you
   create a "chroot jail" with the bare minimum components.
  
  
   This technique is used to provide a higher degree of security.  If
   someone exploited upsd to get a shell somehow, they would be stuck
   in the jail.
</li><li class="listitem">
upssched now explicitly confirms reception of timer commands before
   exiting.  This was done to avoid a race where one process would
   exit right when another one was starting.  The second one would
   believe its command had been handled when it had been lost.
</li><li class="listitem">
upslog has been reworked to use standard getopt parsing to provide
   the monitoring settings.  The old way of specifying arguments is
   still supported for backwards compatibility.
  
  
   upslog has also been changed to only parse the format string once,
   rather than doing it every time through the loop.  This should
   provide a minuscule drop in CPU utilization.
</li><li class="listitem">
Usernames are now required in upsmon and upsd.  This means that you
   must add a username to your MONITOR lines in upsmon.conf and then
   create a matching user in upsd.users.
  
  
   Installations from the 1.2 era probably already used usernames, so
   this mostly affects those from 1.0 and before.
</li><li class="listitem">
Drivers are now pinged regularly by upsd when they aren’t posting
   updates about the UPS status.  This provides another check in the
   data validation process.  If upsd fails to get a response within
   a few seconds, the UPS will be marked stale.
</li><li class="listitem">
A few minor memory leaks were discovered with valgrind and squashed.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsstats now reuses connections to upsd when cycling through multiple
   entries in the hosts.conf.  This makes things a bit faster and
   avoids some of the noise in the syslog.
  
  
   This only applies to entries that are adjacent.  To take advantage
   of this feature, you may have to rearrange them per example below.
  
  
   Connection reuse for nonadjacent entries may be considered in the
   future.

upsd now warns about insecure configuration files at startup.
   These files (upsd.conf, upsd.users, and the certfile) should
   only be readable by upsd.  Never make them world-readable.
</li><li class="listitem">
The programs no longer print "shutting down" when they are just
   exiting.  This was changed to avoid confusion about the term, since
   "shutting down" has a special meaning in UPS software.
</li><li class="listitem">
Signal handlers no longer do any significant amount of work.  Some of
   the programs used to do numerous things in there, raising concerns
   about reentrancy.  They now set flags and allow the main loop to do
   the actual work from there.
</li><li class="listitem">
A bug in upsmon where NOTIFYFLAG settings could be ignored was fixed.
</li><li class="listitem">
Group handling has been changed.  configure no longer accepts
   --with-group, and the programs no longer setgid() to a hardcoded
   value.  They now setgid() to the primary group of whatever the
   user value may be.
  
  
   This may be compiled in with --with-user as before, and many programs
   accept -u to override it at runtime.
</li><li class="listitem">
The state path is no longer created during <span class="emphasis"><em>make install</em></span>.  Users
   are now expected to create it themselves.  This removes a lot of
   evil complexity from the build and install sequences.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsd no longer implements the DROP access command, as it
   could confuse the clients by getting them out of sync.  DROP is now
   implemented as DENY, which sends an error message.  If you use DROP,
   you should change it to DENY rather than relying on this
   compatibility measure.
</li><li class="listitem">
The belkin driver no longer reports OFF and OL at the same time.

   status data before using it.
</li><li class="listitem">
An explicit cleanup function has been added to the driver core to
   ensure that all dynamic resources are freed before exiting.  This
   is part of the larger process to check for memory leaks and other
   bad things.

</li><li class="listitem">
upsd now provides variable descriptions from an auxiliary file.
   This file is optional, which allows for a smaller memory footprint.
   It can also be edited for localization or other customizations.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsimage and upsstats can now render BATTVOLT data.
   [Andrew R. Ghali]
</li><li class="listitem">
String handling has been cleaned up throughout the tree.  Calls to
   functions like strcpy and strcat were either replaced with other
   (range-checking) functions or were rewritten to avoid it.
</li><li class="listitem">
Many compile-time defaults may now be overridden at runtime.  In
   the environment NUT_CONFPATH and NUT_STATEPATH may be used.
   upsdrvctl has been changed to execve to pass these along to the
   drivers.  ups.conf now supports driverpath=, and upsd.conf supports
   DATAPATH.

</li><li class="listitem">
The configure --with-gd switches now actually do something useful
   when gd has been installed outside the default search directories.
   [Patrik Schindler]
</li><li class="listitem">
The inline keyword is now handled properly on systems which do not
   support it or have it specified as another name.  This was breaking
   compiles on some systems.

The snmp-ups driver has been upgraded and expanded.  It now supports
   multiple MIBs, meaning it can handle RFC 1628, APCC, and MGE
   equipment.  You can pick the right one with "mibs=" in ups.conf.
  
  
   Support for setting variable and instant commands is also available.
   [Arnaud Quette and Dmitry Frolov]
</li><li class="listitem">
The powernet driver has been upgraded.  It now supports more
   variables, has cleaner logging, and may now be considered stable.
   [Dmitry Frolov]
</li><li class="listitem">
The hidups driver now supports physical port IDs.  This avoids most
   of the problems where the hiddev* names can jump around too easily.
   It will now stay in the same place as long as you keep it plugged
   into the same physical port.  See the ChangeLog file for more details.

The hidups driver now also supports the MFR variable on APC
   Back-UPS ES equipment.

The sms driver has been updated to version 0.70.

</li><li class="listitem">
The bestups driver now recognizes Best Power Axxium Rackmount
   equipment.
   [Ales Casar]
</li><li class="listitem">
The liebert driver now uses O_NONBLOCK, and should now work
   consistently on OpenBSD as a result.
   [Alex Cichowski]
</li><li class="listitem">
The liebert driver also now uses debouncing logic on the status
   lines.  It was possible to get false readings that would start a
   shutdown or just annoy users with excessive onbatt/online notify
   messages.  The new code forces the status to settle down for 3 polls
   before accepting the new value.
  
  
   This means that very short power events may not be detected.  The
   alternative is having your machine shut down just because it decided
   to wiggle over to OB LB for a few seconds.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsmon has had the disconnect logic fixed so the "communications
   lost" (COMMBAD) notify will actually go out when the connection
   fails.
   [Steve Monett]
</li><li class="listitem">
upssched now uses a lock file to prevent a race where two could
   start at the same time.  The second upssched would "win", and the
   first one would be unreachable.  This had the side-effect of not
   being able to cancel timers on the first one.
  
  
   If you use upssched, you must define the LOCKFN directive when
   upgrading to this version, or it will not work.

The packaging and scripts for Red Hat systems have been updated.
   [Antonino Albanese]

upsd is now a bit more lenient about access levels in the
   <span class="emphasis"><em>numlogins</em></span> check, which is what caused the problem in upsmon
   (next item).
</li><li class="listitem">
upsmon no longer gets stuck in slavesync() when upsd is configured
   to drop certain queries.  This usually happened at the worst
   possible time: in the middle of a shutdown.
   [John David Garza]
</li><li class="listitem">
The upsclient functions now do more sanity checking on data from
   upsd so a short read won’t return garbage to the callers.
</li><li class="listitem">
upsset now works properly with ENUM/VARTYPE values for multiple
   UPSes on a single upsd.
   [Dmitry Frolov]
</li><li class="listitem">
Various portability fixes for building on SGI were applied.
   [Andrea Suatoni]
</li><li class="listitem">
upsd no longer tries to reference a deleted client structure if the
   client disconnects at the wrong time.  Previously, it tried to use
   that pointer after the sendback() function had already failed on
   write and deleted the client.  This could cause upsd to segfault
   depending on what areas were accessed.

The old multilink driver is back with a new name: liebert.  It
