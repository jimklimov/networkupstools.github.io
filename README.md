# networkupstools.github.io

This Git repository hosts the NUT website under github.io control.

Contents are updated currently by NUT project maintainers according to
procedure outlined at https://github.com/networkupstools/nut-website/
which is to populate that workspace, configure and `make` the content
in the `output/` sub-directory, and commit its copy into this repo.

Even more likely for regular automated updates, it is refreshed by
the NUT CI farm following the automated procedure contained in the
`nut-website` files, specifically `ci_build.sh` and `Jenkinsfile`
recipe scripts.
