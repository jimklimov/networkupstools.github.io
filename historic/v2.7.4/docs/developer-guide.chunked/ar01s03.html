releases) are detailed on the main site and may differ from ones
described here.</p></div><p>This document is intended to explain some of the more useful things
within the tree, and provide a standard for working on the code.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_general_stuff_common_subdirectory"></a>3.1. General stuff - common subdirectory</h3></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_string_handling"></a>String handling</h4></div></div></div><p>Use snprintf().  It’s even provided with a compatibility module if the
target system doesn’t have it natively.</p><p>If you use snprintf() to load some value into a buffer, make sure you
provide the format string.  Don’t use user-provided format strings,
since that’s an easy way to open yourself up to an exploit.</p><p>Don’t use strcat().  We have a neat wrapper for snprintf() called snprintfcat()
that allows you to append to char * with a format string and all the usual
string length checking of snprintf().</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_error_reporting"></a>Error reporting</h4></div></div></div><p>Don’t call syslog() directly.  Use upslog_with_errno() and upslogx().
They may write to the syslog, stderr, or both as appropriate.  This
means you don’t have to worry about whether you’re running in the
background or not.</p><p>upslog_with_errno prints your message plus the string expansion of
errno.  upslogx just prints the message.</p><p>fatal_with_errno and fatalx work the same way, but they
exit(EXIT_FAILURE) afterwards. Don’t call exit() directly.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_debugging_information"></a>Debugging information</h4></div></div></div><p>upsdebug_with_errno(), upsdebugx(), upsdebug_hex() and upsdebug_ascii()
use the global <code class="literal">nut_debug_level</code> so you don’t have to mess around with
printf()s yourself.  Use them.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_memory_allocation"></a>Memory allocation</h4></div></div></div><p>xmalloc, xcalloc, xrealloc and xstrdup all check the results of the base

directly.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_config_file_parsing"></a>Config file parsing</h4></div></div></div><p>The configuration parser, called parseconf, is now up to its fourth
major version.  It has multiple entry points, and can handle many
different jobs.  It’s usually used for parsing files, but it can also
take input a line at a time or even a character at a time.</p><p>You must initialize a context buffer with pconf_init before using any
other parseconf function.  pconf_encode is the only exception, since it
operates on a buffer you supply and is an auxiliary function.</p><p>Escaping special characters and quoting multiple-word elements is all
handled by the state machine.  Using the same code for all config files
avoids code duplication.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>this does not apply to drivers.  Driver authors should use the
upsdrv_makevartable() scheme to pick up values from ups.conf.  Drivers
should not have their own config files.</p></div><p>Drivers may have their own data files, such as lists of hardware,
mapping tables, or similar.  The difference between a data file and a
config file is that users should never be expected to edit a data file
under normal circumstances.  This technique might be used to add more
hardware support to a driver without recompiling.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_lt_time_h_gt_vs_lt_sys_time_h_gt"></a>&lt;time.h&gt; vs. &lt;sys/time.h&gt;</h4></div></div></div><p>This is already handled by autoconf, so just include "timehead.h" and you
will get the right headers on every system.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_device_drivers_main_c"></a>3.2. Device drivers - main.c</h3></div></div></div><p>The device drivers use main.c as their core.</p><p>To write a new driver, you create a file with a series of support
functions that will be called by main.  These all have names that start
with <code class="literal">upsdrv_</code>, and they will be called at different times by main
depending on what needs to happen.</p><p>See the <a class="link" href="ar01s04.html" title="4. Creating a new driver to support another device">driver documentation</a> for information on writing
drivers, and also refer to the skeletal driver in skel.c.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_portability"></a>3.3. Portability</h3></div></div></div><p>Avoid things that will break on other systems.  All the world is not an
x86 Linux box.</p><p>There are still older systems out there that don’t do C++ style comments.</p><pre class="screen">/* Comments look like this. */
// Not like this.</pre><p>Newer versions of gcc allow you to declare a variable inside a function
somewhat like the way C++ operates, like this:</p><pre class="screen">function do_stuff(void)
{
        check_something();

        int a;

        a = do_something_else();
}</pre><p>While this will compile and run on these newer versions, it will fail
miserably for anyone on an older system.  That means you must not use
it.  gcc only warns about this with -pedantic.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_coding_style"></a>3.4. Coding style</h3></div></div></div><p>This is how we do things:</p><pre class="screen">int open_subspace(char *ship, int privacy)
{
        if (!privacy)
                return insecure_channel(ship);

        if (!init_privacy(ship))
                fatal_with_errno("Can't open secure channel");

        return secure_channel(ship);
}</pre><p>The basic idea is that we try to group things into functions, and then
find ways to drop out of them when we can’t go any further.  There’s
another way to program this involving a big else chunk and a bunch of
braces, and it can be hard to follow.  You can read this from top to
bottom and have a pretty good idea of what’s going on without having to
track too much { } nesting and indenting.</p><p>We don’t really care for pretentiousVariableNamingSchemes, but you can
probably get away with it in your own driver that we will never have to
touch.  If your function or variable names start pushing important code
off the right margin of the screen, expect them to meet the byte
chainsaw sooner or later.</p><p>All types defined with typedef should end in "_t", because this is
easier to read, and it enables tools (such as indent and emacs) to
display the source code correctly.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_indenting_with_tabs_vs_spaces"></a>Indenting with tabs vs. spaces</h4></div></div></div><p>Another thing to notice is that the indenting happens with tabs instead
of spaces.  This lets everyone have their personal tab-width setting
without inflicting much pain on other developers.  If you use a space,
then you’ve fixed the spacing in stone and have really annoyed half of
the people out there.</p><p>Note that tabs apply only to <span class="strong"><strong>indenting</strong></span>.  Alignment of text after any
non-tab character has appeared on the line must be done by spaces in
order for it to remain at the same alignment when someone views tabs at
a different widths.</p><p>If you write something that uses spaces, you may get away with it in a
driver that’s relatively secluded.  However, if we have to work on that
code, expect it to get reformatted according to the above.</p><p>Patches to existing code that don’t conform to the coding style being
used in that file will probably be dropped.  If it’s something we really
need, it will be grudgingly reformatted before being included.</p><p>When in doubt, have a look at Linus’s take on this topic in the Linux
kernel - Documentation/CodingStyle.  He’s done a far better job of
explaining this.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_line_breaks"></a>Line breaks</h4></div></div></div><p>It is better to have lines that are longer than 80 characters than to
wrap lines in random places. This makes it easier to work with tools
such as "grep", and it also lets each developer choose their own
window size and tab setting without being stuck to one particular
choice.</p><p>Of course, this does not mean that lines should be made unnecessarily
long when there is a better alternative (see the note on
pretentiousVariableNamingSchemes above).  Certainly there should not
be more than one statement per line. Please do not use</p><pre class="screen">if (condition) break;</pre><p>but use the following:</p><pre class="screen">if (condition) {
        break;
}</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_miscellaneous_coding_style_tools"></a>3.5. Miscellaneous coding style tools</h3></div></div></div><p>You can go a long way towards converting your source code to the NUT
coding style by piping it through the following command:</p><pre class="literallayout">indent -kr -i8 -T FILE -l1000 -nhnl</pre><p>This next command does a reasonable job of converting most C++ style
comments (but not URLs and DOCTYPE strings):</p><pre class="literallayout">sed 's#(^|[ t])//[ t]*(.*)[ t]*#/* 2 */#'</pre><p>Emacs users can adjust how tabs are displayed. For example, it is
possible to set a tab stop to be 3 spaces, rather than the usual 8.
(Note that in the saved file, one indentation level will still
correspond to one tab stop; the difference is only how the file is
rendered on screen). It is even possible to set this on a
per-directory basis, by putting something like this into your .emacs
file:</p><pre class="screen">;; NUT style

(defun nut-c-mode ()
 "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with the NUT sources."
 (interactive)
 (c-mode)
 (c-set-style "K&amp;R")
 (setq c-basic-offset 3)  ;; 3 spaces C-indentation
 (setq tab-width 3))      ;; 3 spaces per tab

;; apply NUT style to all C source files in all subdirectories of nut/

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '(".*/nut/.*\.[ch]$". nut-c-mode)
                       auto-mode-alist))</pre><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_finishing_touches"></a>Finishing touches</h4></div></div></div><p>We like code that uses const and static liberally.  If you don’t need to
expose a function or global variable to the outside world, static is
your friend.  If nobody should edit the contents of some buffer that’s
behind a pointer, const keeps them honest.</p><p>We always compile with -Wall, so things like const and static help you
find implementation flaws.  Functions that attempt to modify a constant
or access something outside their scope will throw a warning or even
fail to compile in some cases.  This is what we want.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_spaghetti"></a>Spaghetti</h4></div></div></div><p>If you use a goto, expect us to drop it when our head stops spinning.
It gives us flashbacks to the very old code we wrote.
We’ve tried to clean up our act, and you should make the effort
as well.</p><p>We’re not making a blanket statement about gotos, since everything
probably has at least one good use.  There are a few cases where a goto
is more efficient than any other approach, but you probably won’t
encounter them very often in this software.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_legacy_code"></a>Legacy code</h4></div></div></div><p>There are parts of the source tree that do not yet conform to these
specs.  Part of this is due to the fact that the coding style has been
evolving slightly over the course of the project.  Some of the code you
see in these directories is 5 years old, and things have gotten cleaner
since then.  Don’t worry - it’ll get cleaned up the next time something
in the vicinity gets a visit.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_memory_leak_checking"></a>Memory leak checking</h4></div></div></div><p>We can’t say enough good things about valgrind.  If you do anything with
dynamic memory in your code, you need to use this.  Just compile with -g
and start the program inside valgrind.  Run it through the suspected
area and then exit cleanly.  valgrind will tell you if you’ve done
anything dodgy like freeing regions twice, reading uninitialized memory,
or if you’ve leaked memory anywhere.</p><p>For more information, refer to the <a class="ulink" href="http://valgrind.kde.org" target="_top">Valgrind</a>
project.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4></div></div></div><p>The summary: please be kind to our eyes.  There’s a lot of stuff in here,
and many people have put a lot of time and energy to improve it.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_submitting_patches"></a>3.6. Submitting patches</h3></div></div></div><p>Small patches that arrive in unified format (diff -u) as plain text attachments
with no HTML and a brief summary at the top are the easiest to handle.</p><p>If a patch is sent to the nut-upsdev mailing list, it stands a better chance of
being seen immediately. However, it is likely to be dropped if any issues
cannot be resolved quickly. If your code might not work for others, or if it is
a large change, your best bet is to submit a pull request or create an
<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/issues" target="_top">issue on GitHub</a>.</p><p>The issue tracker allows us to track the patches over a longer period of time,
and it is less likely that a patch will fall through the cracks. Posting a
reminder to the developers (via the nut-upsdev list) about a patch on GitHub is
fair game.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_patch_cohesion"></a>3.7. Patch cohesion</h3></div></div></div><p>Patches should have some kind of unifying element.  One patch set is one
message, and it should all touch similar things.  If you have to edit 6
files to add support for neutrino detection in UPS hardware, that’s
fine.</p><p>However, sending one huge patch that does massive separate changes all over
the tree is not recommended.  That kind of patch has to be split up and
evaluated separately, assuming the core developers care enough to do that
instead of just dropping it.</p><p>If you have to make big changes in lots of places, send multiple
patches - one per item.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_the_finishing_touches_manual_pages_and_device_entry_in_hcl"></a>3.8. The finishing touches: manual pages and device entry in HCL</h3></div></div></div><p>If you change something that involves an argument to a program or
configuration file parsing, the man page is probably now out of date.
If you don’t update it, we have to, and we have enough to do as it is.</p><p>If you write a new driver, send in the man page when you send us the
source code for your driver.  Otherwise, we will be forced to write a
skeletal man page that will probably miss many of the finer points of
the driver and hardware.</p><p>The same remark goes for device entries: if you add support for new models,
remember to also complete the hardware compatibility list, present
in data/driver.list.in. This will be used to generate both textual, static
HTML and dynamic searchable HTML for the website.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_source_code_management"></a>3.9. Source code management</h3></div></div></div><p>We currently use a Git repository hosted at GitHub (with a mirror at Alioth) to track
changes to the NUT source code. This allows you to clone the repository (or
fork, in GitHub parlance), make changes, and post them online for review prior
to integration.</p><p>To obtain permission to commit directly to the master NUT repository, you must
be prepared to spend a fair amount of time contributing to the NUT codebase.
Most developers will be well served by committing to their own Git repository,
and having the NUT team merge their changes.</p><p>Git offers a little more flexibility than the <code class="literal">svn update</code> command. You may
fetch other developers' changes into your repository, but hold off on
actually combining them with your branch until you have compared the two
branches (for instance, with <code class="literal">gitk --all</code>). Git also allows you to accumulate
more than one commit worth of changes before pushing to another repository.
This allows development to continue without a constant network connection.</p><p>For a quick change to a file in the Git working copy, you can use <code class="literal">git diff</code> to
generate a patch to send to the nut-upsdev mailing list.  If you have more
extensive changes, you can use <code class="literal">git format-patch</code> on a complete commit or
branch, and send the resulting series of patches to the list.</p><p>If you use GitHub’s web-based editor to make changes, it tends to create lots
of small commits, one per change per file. Unless there is reason to keep the
intermediate history, we will probably collapse the entire branch into one
commit with <code class="literal">git rebase -i</code> before merging.</p><p>The <a class="ulink" href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSvnCrashCourse" target="_top">GitSvnCrashCourse</a>
wiki page has some useful information for long-time users of Subversion.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_git_access"></a>Git access</h4></div></div></div><p>Anonymous Git checkouts are possible:</p><pre class="literallayout">git clone git://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git</pre><p>or</p><pre class="literallayout">git clone https://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git</pre><p>if it is necessary to get around a pesky firewall that blocks the native Git
protocol.</p><p>For a quicker checkout (when you don’t need the entire repository history),
you can limit the depth of the clone:</p><pre class="literallayout">git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git</pre><p>In case the GitHub repository is temporarily unavailable for any reason, we
also plan to push to Alioth’s
<a class="ulink" href="https://alioth.debian.org/scm/?group_id=30602" target="_top">Git server</a> as well. You can
add a remote reference to your local repository:</p><pre class="literallayout">cd path/to/nut
git remote add -f alioth git://anonscm.debian.org/nut/nut.git</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_mercurial_hg_access"></a>Mercurial (hg) access</h4></div></div></div><p>There are those who prefer the simplicity and self-consistency of the Mercurial
SCM client over the hodgepodge of unique commands which make up Git. Rather
than debate the merits of each system, we will gently guide you towards the
<a class="ulink" href="http://hg-git.github.com/" target="_top">hg-git project</a> which would theoretically be a
transparent bridge between the central Git repository, and your local Mercurial
working copy.</p><p>Other tools for hg/git interoperability are sure to exist. We would welcome any
feedback about this process on the nut-upsdev mailing list.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="_subversion_svn_access"></a>Subversion (SVN) access</h4></div></div></div><p>If you prefer to check out the NUT source code using an SVN client, GitHub
has a <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/blog/966-improved-subversion-client-support" target="_top">SVN
interface to Git repositories</a> hosted on their servers. You can fork a copy of
the NUT repository and commit to your fork with SVN.</p><p>Be aware that the examples in the GitHub blog post might result in a checkout
that includes all of the current branches, as well as the trunk. You are most
likely interested in a command line similar to the following:</p><pre class="literallayout">svn co https://github.com/networkupstools/nut/trunk nut-trunk-svn</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_ignoring_generated_files"></a>3.10. Ignoring generated files</h3></div></div></div><p>The NUT repository generally only holds files which are not generated from
other files. This prevents spurious differences from being recorded in the
repository history.</p><p>If you add a driver, it is recommended that you add the driver executable name
to the .gitignore file in that directory. Similarly, files generated from *.in
and *.am sources should be ignored as well. We try to include a number of
generated files in the tarball releases with <code class="literal">make dist</code> hooks in order to
minimize the number of dependencies for end users, but the assumption is that
a developer can install the packages needed to regenerate those files.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_commit_message_formatting"></a>3.11. Commit message formatting</h3></div></div></div><p>From the <code class="literal">git commit</code> man page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single
short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank
line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line
in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used
throughout git.</p></blockquote></div><p>If your commit is just a change to one component, such as the HCL, upsd or a
specific driver, prefix your commit message in a way that matches similar
commits. This helps when searching the repository or tracking down a
regression.</p><p>Referring to previous commits can be tricky. If you are referring to the
immediate parent of a given commit, it suffices to say "the previous commit".
(Are you correcting a typo in the previous commit? If you haven’t pushed yet,
consider using the <code class="literal">git commit --amend</code> command instead of creating a new
commit.) For other commits, even though tools like gitk and GitHub’s
repository viewers recognize Git hashes and create links automatically, it is
best to add some context such as the commit title or a date.</p><p>You may notice that some older commits have <code class="literal">[[SVN:####]]</code> tags and Fossil-ID
footers. These were lifted from the old SVN commit messages using reposurgeon,
and should <span class="strong"><strong>not</strong></span> be used as a guide for future commits.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_repository_etiquette_and_quality_assurance"></a>3.12. Repository etiquette and quality assurance</h3></div></div></div><p>Please keep the Git master branch in working condition at all times. The
master branch may be used to generate daily tarballs, and should not contain
broken code. If you need to commit incremental changes that leave the system
in a broken state, please do so in a separate branch and merge the changes
back into master once they are complete.</p><p>You are encouraged to use <code class="literal">git rebase -i</code> on your private Git branches to
separate your changes into <a class="link" href="ar01s03.html#_patch_cohesion" title="3.7. Patch cohesion">logical changes</a>.</p><p>From there, you can generate patches for the issue tracker, or the nut-upsdev list.</p><p>Note that once you rebase a branch, anyone else who has a copy of this branch
will need to rebase on top of your rebased branch. Obviously, this hinders
collaboration. In this case, we recommend that you rebase only in your private
repository, and push when things are ready for discussion. Merging instead of
rebasing will help with collaboration, but please do not turn the repository
history into a pile of spaghetti by merging unnecessarily. (Test merges can be
done on integration branches, which can be discarded if the merge is trivial.)
Be sure that your commit messages are descriptive when merging.</p><p>If you haven’t created a commit out of your local changes yet, and you want to
fetch the latest code, you can also use <code class="literal">git stash</code> before pulling, then <code class="literal">git
stash pop</code> to apply your saved changes.</p><p>Here is an example workflow:</p><pre class="screen">        git clone -o central git://github.com/networkupstools/nut.git

This script
generates the <code class="literal">./configure</code> script that end users typically invoke to build
NUT. If you are making a number of changes to the NUT source tree, configuring
with the <code class="literal">--enable-maintainer-mode</code> flag will ensure that after you change
<code class="literal">Makefile.am</code>, the <code class="literal">Makefile.in</code> and <code class="literal">Makefile</code> get regenerated. At a
minimum, you will need:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

for root privileges when testing new NUT code, you may wish to use
<code class="literal">--prefix=$HOME/local/nut --with-statepath=/tmp</code>. You can also keep
compilation times down by only building the driver you are currently working

checks that the Makefiles are not broken, that all the
relevant files are distributed, and that there are no compilation or
installation errors. Note that this requires all of the dependencies necessary
to build the documentation, including asciidoc, a2x, xsltproc, dblatex and any
additional XSL stylesheets.</p><p>Running <code class="literal">make distcheck-light</code> is especially important if you have added or
removed files, or updated configure.in or some Makefile.am.  Remember: simply
adding a file to Git does not mean it will be distributed. To distribute a
file, you must update the corresponding Makefile.am.</p><p>There is also <code class="literal">make distcheck</code>, which runs an even stricter set of
tests than <code class="literal">make distcheck-light</code>, but will not work unless you have all the
optional libraries and features installed.</p><p>Even if you do not use your distribution’s packages of NUT, installing the
distribution’s list of build dependencies for NUT can reduce the amount of
trial-and-error when installing dependencies. For instance, in Debian, you can
run <code class="literal">apt-get build-dep nut</code> to install all of the auto* tools as well as any
development libraries and headers.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="navfooter nut_footer"><hr />
